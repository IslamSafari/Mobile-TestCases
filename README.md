# Mobile-TestCases
In this Blog I have Made 4 Test cases using Appium - TestNG - Maven
First We will need to add all required dependencies for the Maven into The POM.XML File
Then we will need to use a simulator to be able to select Elements in my case I've used Appium Studio
Then we will need to set the device in eclipse and set DesiredCapabilities
Then The 4 cases As Follow 
1-TC for Successfull Registration then assertion
2-TC for Pop up messages
3-TC to be sure Progress par id working well and direct to reg page
4-Finally TC to Check for The Temp text shown when click on a button
